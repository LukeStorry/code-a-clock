> Processing is easy for creating visual art with a few simple lines, and is ideal for learning how to code. 

Students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists use Processing for learning and prototyping projects.  
[Visit this link](https://processing.org/exhibition/) to see some of the examples of interesting prototypes and projects.
